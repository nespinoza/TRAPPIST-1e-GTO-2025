For the scripts here to work, you need to go to the espinoza+2025/figure3/ folder and download the `retrieval-results` file there. 

Retrieval results live at: https://stsci.box.com/s/s0g9v1arzqwhq39dr30y2m8n8bnn2hx7.

Put them under `espinoza+2025/figure3/retrieval-results` and these scripts will work.
